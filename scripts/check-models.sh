# The Automix model download, against a fixture server.
#
# The app fetches two ONNX graphs at runtime, and the parts of that which can fail
# quietly are the parts a real download almost never shows you: a resumed transfer
# that starts over, a checksum that lets a truncated graph through, a metered
# connection that gets used after the listener said no. So this drives all of them
# through the real store — real URLSession, real SHA-256, real files — against
# scripts/models-verify/fixture.py, which can be made to lie in the exact ways the
# code claims to defend against.
#
# Set MODELS_LIVE=1 to also download the real pinned Beat This! graph and check it
# against the digest in AutomixModelStore.swift, which is the only thing that
# catches the manifest drifting away from Hugging Face.
