// The sign-in web view's identity, asked of the real engine and of Google's own
// answer.
//
// The reported failure was Google's "This browser or app may not be secure" page
// on iOS, before any password was typed. That is Google's refusal of an embedded
// web view, so the only honest way to check the fix is to load the *actual* login
// URL in a web view carrying the agent the app will use, and read what Google
// says. A test that only inspected the string would prove the string is shaped
// like a desktop browser, which is necessary and nowhere near sufficient.
//
// Driven by the run loop rather than by async, because every part of it is a
// callback into a web view on the main thread and wrapping that in continuations
// only obscures what is being waited for.
//
// Needs a network. Separate from `check-signin.sh`, which is pure.
