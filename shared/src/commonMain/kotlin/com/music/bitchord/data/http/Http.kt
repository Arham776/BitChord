/**
 * One HTTP seam for the whole app (port of upstream `data/Http.kt` per spec
 * §1.2). The point of it being *one* seam is upstream's, and it is load-bearing:
 *
 *  > googlevideo binds a stream URL to the connection context of the `player`
 *  > request that minted it. If Innertube and the media fetch used separate
 *  > HTTP stacks they could resolve to different addresses (v4 vs v6) and the
 *  > media fetch would come back 403.
 *
 * So the Darwin actual runs one client on one `URLSession` and every caller —
 * innertube, the media fetch, the range probe, the lyrics and canvas providers
 * — goes through it.
 *
 * ## How the session cookie travels
 *
 * As a request **header**, exactly as upstream sends it (`Innertube.authHeaders`
 * puts `Cookie` in the header map and nothing writes it to a jar). That is the
 * whole mechanism, and it is the correct one:
 *
 *  - An `HTTPCookieStorage` is domain-scoped, so a session written to one for
 *    `.youtube.com` could never reach `*.googlevideo.com` anyway. Isolating
 *    the media client from the session was buying nothing.
 *  - The only way that isolation *could* have worked — mirroring the header
 *    into a jar — is a duplicate. A `URLSession` configured with
 *    `httpShouldSetCookies` sends the jar's cookies *and* the explicit header,
 *    so every signed-in request went out with two `Cookie` headers.
 *  - The jar version had to re-derive each cookie's domain by string surgery on
 *    the header, with a `__Host-` special case and no handling for the
 *    `__Secure-` forms Google actually sets, and it cleared the entire jar on
 *    every sign-in — taking unrelated provider cookies with it.
 *
 * [setHostCookies] below is the one place a jar is written, and it is for
 * cookies a *provider* needs on a later request to a host we already know
 * (Spotify's `sp_dc`). It is never used for the account session.
