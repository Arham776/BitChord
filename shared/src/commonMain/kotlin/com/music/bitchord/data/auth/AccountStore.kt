/**
 * The signed-in accounts, and which YouTube identity is active, as Swift sees
 * it. Upstream `AuthStore` + `AccountSessions`, ported whole.
 *
 * ## Why accounts are stored as one JSON blob
 *
 * The alternative is a key per account, and a key per account means a key whose
 * *name* is an account id — which then has to be escaped, enumerated to find,
 * and removed when the last account goes. One JSON value under one key has
 * none of that: the accounts are a list, the list is the value, and clearing the
 * store is clearing the store.
 *
 * ## Why the whole blob is one secret
 *
 * A cookie is a credential: it grants full access to the account, so it belongs
 * in the Keychain rather than in `NSUserDefaults`. Upstream reaches the same
 * place with `EncryptedPrefs`, which is Android's Keystore-backed store, and
 * degrades to plain prefs when the Keystore is unavailable — a degradation this
 * port does not need, because the Keychain is always there.
 *
 * One key rather than one per account, deliberately. A key per account would
 * need the key's *name* to be an account id, which then has to be escaped,
 * enumerated to find, and removed when the last account goes. One value under
 * one key has none of that. It also means the existing `SECRET_KEYS` backup and
 * export path covers the accounts with no new entry, which a dynamic set of keys
 * could not do without that list becoming dynamic too.
 *
 * ## Why the id chains live in [AccountSessions] and not here
 *
 * They decide which account a selection refers to after a relaunch, and getting
 * one wrong does not produce an error — it produces a selection that silently
 * applies to the wrong account. That is testable arithmetic, so it is tested
 * there rather than buried in a store.
